# comfyui_image_filters

This is a simple image filter library for ComfyUI. It requires no fancy requirements, simply using the basic
torch and numpy libraries. It is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is super helpful for hinting to 
the AI model that you want an image to be dark, with green light. Just feed it a darked, green image, with
0.7 - 0.9 denoise, and you'll get a darker, greener output.
